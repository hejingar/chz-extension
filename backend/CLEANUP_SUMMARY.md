# 🧹 Cleanup Summary - CHZ Event Handler Integration

## ✅ Cleaned Up Files

### 🗑️ Removed Test Files:
- `test-integrated-handler.js` - Test for integrated handler
- `test-full-flow.js` - Full flow test 
- `test-deposit-back.js` - DepositBack function test
- `test-event-flow.js` - Event flow test
- `quick-test.js` - Quick connectivity test
- `debug-new-flow.js` - Debug script for new contract flow
- `check-state.js` - Contract state checker

### 🗑️ Removed Standalone Services:
- `src/chiliz-event-handler.js` - Standalone event handler (functionality moved to ChilizReceiverService)

### 🗑️ Removed Old ABIs:
- `contracts/GoodStake.json` - Old contract ABI (replaced by ChilizReceiver.json)

### 🔧 Cleaned Up Code:
- Removed `manualWithdrawToStake()` function from ChilizReceiverService
- Updated warning messages to reference `depositBack()` instead of `withdrawToStake()`
- Removed references to old `withdrawToStake` functionality

## ✅ Final System Architecture

### 🏗️ **Core Service**: `ChilizService` (src/chiliz-service.js)
- Main service orchestrator
- Initializes all components
- Handles high-level event coordination

### 🔗 **Connection Layer**: `ChilizConnection` (src/chiliz-connection.js)  
- WebSocket and HTTP providers
- Wallet management
- Network connectivity

### 📋 **Contract Handler**: `ChilizReceiverService` (src/chiliz-receiver-service.js)
- **✅ Event Listening**: Listens for `WithdrawalRequested` events
- **✅ Auto-Response**: Automatically calls `depositBack()` when events are detected
- **✅ Balance Checking**: Ensures sufficient owner funds before responding
- **✅ Error Handling**: Graceful handling of insufficient funds or transaction errors

### 💼 **Wallet Manager**: `WalletManager` (src/wallet-manager.js)
- Transaction management
- Balance tracking
- Payment processing

## ✅ Event Flow (Working Perfectly)

```
1. User calls requestWithdrawal(amount) 
   ↓
2. 🚨 WithdrawalRequested event emitted
   ↓
3. 🎧 ChilizReceiverService detects event
   ↓
4. 💰 Checks owner wallet balance
   ↓
5. 📤 Calls depositBack(amount) automatically
   ↓
6. ✅ User can claim after 4-day wait period
```

## ✅ Configuration

### Environment Variables:
```env
AUTO_DEPOSIT_BACK=true                          # Enables automatic response
CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0x4b35a9bfd36c7e47ecefb5697157eb8a24902ef0
CONTRACT_ABI_PATH=./contracts/ChilizReceiver.json
```

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
# Start the integrated system
npm run dev

# Everything is included:
# ✅ Wallet monitoring
# ✅ Event listening  
# ✅ Automatic depositBack responses
# ✅ Real-time logging
```

## ✅ What's Active
